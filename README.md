This task management system demonstrates several key Data Structures and Algorithms concepts.

Data Structures Implemented
1. **Priority Queue (Binary Heap)**: Used for efficient task sorting by priority or due date with O(log n) operations
2. **Trie**: Implements fast prefix-based searching for task titles, descriptions, and tags
3. **Graph**: Manages task dependencies with adjacency lists
4. **Map and Set**: Used for efficient lookups and storage

Algorithms Implemented
1. **Topological Sort**: Orders tasks based on their dependencies
2. **Depth-First Search**: Used for cycle detection in the dependency graph
3. **Binary Heap Operations**: Heapify, sift-up, and sift-down for the priority queue
4. **Prefix Search**: Efficient searching using the trie data structure

### Key Features

- Task creation with priorities, due dates, and dependencies
- Efficient searching with prefix matching
- Dependency tracking with cycle detection
- Task filtering and sorting
- Tag management system
